## Examples

To run the example, install the DITA-OT plugin, then run the following commands:

    cd ./example
    ./runme.sh

Note that

* bookA.ditamap produces a single output deliverable (bookA), and thus map-based scope names can be used.
* bookB.ditamap produces two output deliverables (bookB1, bookB2), and thus directory-based scope names must be used.

Click the following links to see the post-processed published output for the three books:

  [./out/B/bookB1/index.html](out/B/bookB1/index.html)
  [./out/B/bookB2/index.html](out/B/bookB2/index.html)
  [./out/bookA_dir/index.html](out/bookA_dir/index.html)
